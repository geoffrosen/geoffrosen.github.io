The scripts for the [vaginal-microbiome](https://github.com/geoffrosen/vaginal-microbiome) project were getting to cluttered.

I have started a new project that I am for now calling [simple-v-microbiome](https://github.com/geoffrosen/simple-v-microbiome) that has simpler scripts.

Hopefully I can keep them organized.
