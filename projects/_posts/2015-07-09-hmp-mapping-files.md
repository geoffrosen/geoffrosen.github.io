There is no set that clearly shows which 16S sequences are needed for joint analysis

I made one, available [here](https://github.com/geoffrosen/hmp_mapping). All information necessary to duplicate what I did should be available there too. Look at the *.sh file.

Hopefully this makes joint analysis easier.
